1. Tell me about a time you faced a major technical obstacle. How did you resolve it?
-In any situation where I don't understand the root cause of the problem, especially a technical one, I will always ask for help. One story I can recount was in my Multivariate analysis class. Our assignments were set up with R-studio. At the time I had very minimal experience with R but it was a fun learning opportunity. When I had any type of issue that resulted in me feeling frustrated with my inexperience I would search the internet and the R-studio website. If my answers were still not found I would go to a classmate and lastly my professor. I feel that I would apply this in the real-world as well. First look for the answer, then go to my peers, and lastly my higher-ups 
2. Describe a situation where you had to collaborate with someone very different from you.
-I feel that CISC480 senior capstone was the biggest learning curve when it came to collaboration. My group members and I differed in terms of availability, finishing tasks, taking on tasks, etc. As a group we strived hard to utilize each other's strengths. In doing so we were able to divide work and effectively  complete tasks. 
3. What’s a non-technical skill you’ve developed that you’re most proud of? 
-Collaboration is my biggest soft skill that I developed. I am so proud of how far I’ve come and the shell that I grew out of. I did not think such a noticeable change would be noticed. But I was able to understand group setting and how to communicate and collaborate effectively to meet our end goal!
