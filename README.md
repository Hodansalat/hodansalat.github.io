### About Me
Hello! My name is Hodan Salat and I am a graduating student form the University of St. Thomas. I am studying computer science along with statistics. The long journey started back in highschool. I have been in college since I was a senior in highschool doing dual enrollment and now I get to graduate a year early! 

Beyond the academics, I’m someone who values balance and connection. I enjoy reading, watching movies, and spending quality time with my friends. Whether it’s a game night or a spontaneous adventure, I cherish the moments that bring laughter and meaning to life.

I’m excited to see where this next chapter takes me and how I can continue learning, growing, and contributing to the tech world and beyond.
